# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Project


In this project, I worked as a junior data analyst for Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. The goal was to analyze historical trip data and provide insights to maximize annual memberships.
I went through all the phases of Data Analytics namely-- 
ASK, PREPARE, PROCESS, ANALYZE, SHARE, ACT

1. ASK --

I was assigned with 3 Business Problems :
1.How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

2. PREPARE --

The Data provided by them was for 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 years. I chose 2018 data for my analysis. The data was seperated in 4 different excel files quarter wise. I merged the entire data of 2018 in one dataframe. 

3. PROCESS --

Data Processing and Data Cleaning was done using Python (Pandas). All steps performed while cleaning are mentioned in Data Cleaning.ipynb file.

4. ANALYZE --

In order to extract patterns and draw insights about Casual riders and Subscribers, Analysis was performed using SQL. All queries are listed in SQL Analysis.docx. You can also refer

5. SHARE --

The insights draw have been visualized using Tableau. You can refer https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/swara.nabar/viz/CyclisticBikeShareAnalysis_17006292556070/CyclisticBikeShareAnalysis.

6. ACT --

The trends observed were that average ride length of customer is more than subscriber. Also, Customers use the service during weekends that means they use them for planned trips were as subscribers use them for daily commute. We have seen popular stations and we can advertise our services there.
